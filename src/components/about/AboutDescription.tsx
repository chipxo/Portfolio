      In the final year of studying
      <span className="font-bold"> International Relations</span>, I decided
      that I wanted to try something new. I've always been interested in
      programming, but I used to think it required a lot of complex mathematical
      knowledge. When I realized that's not true at all, I decided to give it a
      try and learn <span className="font-bold">front-end development</span>.{" "}
      <span className="italic">My favorite part about programming</span> is that
      you can create something, and it can be whatever you want. I like to
      follow the latest tools like
      <span className="font-bold">
        {" "}
        React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and others
      </span>
      .
